# Pull Request Linter Action

A GitHub action that enforces conventional commit spec on pull requests to ensure a clean commit history. see https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ 

## Features

Uses default commit lint config which is auto generated at build time (`src/main/config/commitlint-config.ts`) based on https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint

FYI: The reason for pre building the config is a workaround since `@commitlint/load` requires typescript as a runtime dependency which causes odd side effects given we build from TS to JS.


## Usage

- Ensure you run these steps before using this action
  - [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)  
- Add the following to a workflow `.yml` file in the `/.github/workflows` directory of your repo

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check out code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: PR Linter
    id: test
    uses: gavinastur/pr-linter-action@main
```


## Commit and PR conventions

Commits should follow the convention `chore: readme update` or `fix(nav-123): my new feature` otherwise the build will fail. For complex examples see the link below. 
PR titles which form the commit to the main branch must contain the following convention so that we can build an informative semantic changelog

`chore:` non functional change to the codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).

`fix:` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH).

`feat:` new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR).

More information on the spec including further options are available here https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ you can also check the rules in (`src/main/config/commitlint-config.ts`)

## Branch conventions

The PR LInter does not validate branch names yet but we suggest the following

`type/subject` or `type_subject`

`jir-123/my-new-feature`

`chore/my-new-feature`

`chore_my-new-feature`


## Notes for maintainers

Because this a GitHub action and requires us to commit the dist folder, some dependency updates cause the dist folder to need updating. Hence you'll see the `dist-check` workflow fail.
To fix this you simply have to checkout that branch, run `npm install` and then commit the dist changes. Bit of a pain, if Renovate could run "Git hooks" it wouldnâ€™t be an issue.
